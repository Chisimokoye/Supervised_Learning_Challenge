# Supervised_Learning_Challenge
In this assignment, you will be building a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not.


Specifically, I compared the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier. 

## Conclusion
Both models performed almost the same. Logistic regression model of 0.9918 compared to the Random Forest model of 0.9917. Based on this i would say the Logistic Regression model performed better.

Also the accuracy scores from the Logistic regression model were higher than the Random forest model ie 0.9918 as against 0.9916. This is further confirmed with the number of true positives reducing from 563 in the logistic regression model to 557 in the Random Forest model
